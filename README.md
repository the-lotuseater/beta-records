# beta-records
Senior-Seminar Project Spring 2019.
An team project that counted towards our final grade. 
This project was very open ended assignment. We were asked to freely choose a team, define a problem statement, design a system and present a thesis. Our group came together owing to a shared interest for machine learning, and this is our brain child.
